# PodcastFolderStructure

This is a tool to automate the creation of a folder structure. It was intended for podcast folder structures but you can use more generally. 
It includes subfolders for each episodes. 
You can set the number of episode folders you want in line 25.
You can also set it to create episode folders that do not start from zero,
using the range(start number, number of folders) instead of range(number of folders)
